## Why Ayako (Now Healthmate)?

Ayako is an idea made after Knox Grammar School introduces a project called ”Global Challenge”, in collaboration with Macquarie University. Right after the announcement, Ayako went into development, hoping that Macquarie Uni and their investors can bring the project to life. Ayako was created in response to the critical need for more equitable healthcare solutions worldwide. In many developing countries, access to quality medical care remains a significant challenge due to limited infrastructure, high costs, and a shortage of healthcare professionals. These barriers often leave vulnerable populations without the care they need, leading to preventable health issues and a lower quality of life.
The vision behind Ayako is to democratise healthcare by providing a tool that can offer accurate and affordable medical advice to anyone, regardless of their location or financial situation. The project was driven by the belief that everyone deserves the right to good health, and that technology can be a powerful force for positive change in this area. By using AI to deliver medical guidance, Ayako addresses the pressing issue of healthcare inequality, offering a solution that is both scalable and sustainable.
Ayako’s development is not just about creating a new technology—it’s about making a real difference in the lives of people who are often overlooked by traditional healthcare systems. This project was made with the hope of bridging the gap between those who have access to quality healthcare and those who do not, ultimately contributing to a world where healthcare is a universal right, not a privilege. The initiative to fund and develop Ayako is a step toward a future where every individual has the opportunity to lead a healthy life, regardless of their circumstances. 

Project started on 8th August, 2024.
